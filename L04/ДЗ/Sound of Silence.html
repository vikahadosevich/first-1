        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            Hello, darkness, my old friend
            I've come to talk with you again
            Because a vision softly creeping
            Left its seeds while I was sleeping
            And the vision that was planted in my brain
            Still remains
            Within the sound of silence</p>

        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            In restless dreams I walked alone
            Narrow streets of cobblestone
            'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
            I turned my collar to the cold and damp
            When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
            That split the night
            And touched the sound of silence</p>

        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            And in the naked light I saw
            Ten thousand people, maybe more
            People talking without speaking
            People hearing without listening
            People writing songs that voices never share
            No one dared
            Disturb the sound of silence</p>

        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            "Fools," said I, "You do not know
            Silence like a cancer grows
            Hear my words that I might teach you
            Take my arms that I might reach you."
            But my words like silent raindrops fell
            And echoed in the wells of silence</p>

        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            And the people bowed and prayed
            To the neon god they made
            And the sign flashed out its warning
            In the words that it was forming
            And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
            Are written on the subway walls
            And tenement halls
            And whispered in the sounds of silence."</p>
